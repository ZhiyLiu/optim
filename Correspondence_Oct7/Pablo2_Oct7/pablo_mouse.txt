                        Use of the Mouse in Pablo


This document describes the mouse actions possible in the 3D Model Window.

Either a two-button or three-button mouse may be used, but with a different
combination of keys to acheive a particular effect.  With a two-button mouse
the middle mouse button must be simulated by using the Shift key with the
left mouse button.  A 3-button mouse allows use of the Ctrl and Alt keys for
some actions.  Some features cannot be accessed with a two-button mouse.

Either the usual right-handed mouse or a left-handed mouse may be used.  If
using the mouse on the left, some guidance produced by Pablo will be incorrect,
unless the mouse setting on the Other tab of the Preferences Editor has been
set to indicate that a left-handed mouse is being used.

An atom is always in one of four states:
    1. Selected, indicated by an enlargement of the atom in the Model Window.
    2. Marked, indicated by a change of color of the atom.
    3. Selected and Marked, which combines the effects of 1 and 2.
    4. None of the above.

Multiple atoms may be selected by dragging a box around them, as described
below.  Selecting an atom that is already selected will unselect it, and an
atom can be unmarked by "marking" it a second time.  Only one atom at a time
can be marked; any number of atoms can be selected.  An entire figure is
considered selected, if all of its atoms are selected.  It is considered marked
if one of its atoms is marked.

Tiles are divided into tile-figures, each of which was loaded from a
separate tile file or generated independently. For instance, "Export Model
To BYU Tiles..." will generate a tile-figure per model figure.
Each tile-figure may be individually selected for editing; see the checkboxes in:
  Display Control -> TileSet -> Move Figs
Additionally, the Mobile checkbox must be enabled to edit tile-figures.

Two kinds of actions are controlled by dragging the mouse:
- editing actions change the objects, and
- view actions affect the camera only.
The editing actions operate on atoms or figures that are selected or marked,
and on tile-figures when in "Mobile" mode, according to the rules below.

The following table summarizes the actions available with each combination
of the keys and mouse buttons.  If a left-handed mouse is used, then the
words "right" and "left" must be exchanged.


Left Button Actions
===================

No keys         Rotate the view using a "trackball" model.
Ctrl            Select an atom or figure by clicking or dragging.
Alt             Rotate the selected atoms and mobile tile-figures
                  about the center of the view using the trackball
                  interaction model.
Shift           Translate the view.  (Middle-button substitute).
Shift + Alt     Translate the selected atoms.  (Middle-button substitute).
Shift + Alt     Pirouette (rotate) each mobile tile-figure about it's
                  own axis. (3-button mouse only).


Middle Button Actions
=====================

No keys         Translate the view using the "trackball" model.
Ctrl            No action.
Alt             Translate the selected atoms within the view plane.
Shift           No action.
Shift + Alt     No action.


Right Button Actions
====================

No keys         Scale the view; dragging down zooms in.
Ctrl            Mark an atom by clicking.
Alt             Scale the selected atoms and their inter-atom distances about
                  their center of gravity; drag down to enlarge.
Shift           No action.
Shift + Alt     Scale the selected atoms, in place. Does not affect tile-figures
