SVN-Tagged Releases
-------------------

Pablo-1-2-0	This is a working Pablo2 after merging with Binary Pablo,
		but before the handling of tubular objects was added.

Pablo-1-2-1	This Pablo2 contains working code for fitting tubes.  It is
		the last release before the world coordinate system in Image3D
		was reworked, flipping of .raw3 images was eliminated, and
		PlanIm I/O was made to work.  This corresponds to SVN revision
		397.

Pablo-1-3-0	This is a working Pablo2 made about 9 months after Morphormics
		began operations.  It had the Ph.D. work of Joshua Stough and
		Eli Broadhurst, and supports ConStruct as of July 1, 2009.  It
		does not support S-Reps.

Pablo-1-4-0	This is a working Pablo2 containing minor improvements and
		changes from the previous tagged version.  It is the last
		tagged version prior to changing the program to use the
		Morphormics .m3d file format and providing a general skeleton
		data structure for mreps.
