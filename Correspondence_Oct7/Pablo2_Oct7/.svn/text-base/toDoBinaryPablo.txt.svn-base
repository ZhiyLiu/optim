This is Gregg Tracton's list from v.14 of Binary Pablo.
--------------------------

TO DO

'x' means Done. # means priority. 'I' means ignore

SWITCHES
x add landmark model switch (-bpLandmark)
x add tile output (-bpTile)
4 add log output (-bpLog)

GENERAL
x write byu file in image/world coords
x clean up registry to include this:
  - MOM: add rotate, translate, scale options
  - Rigid Figure weights: image match, landmark
  - PGA weights: image match, maha distance (PGA/eigenCoords), landmark
  - set ref model
  - atom weights: image match, ref model, atom nei, landmark
  - NO multiple atom stages
x when reading model, enable PGA if stat's present

GUI
- atom stage: change 3 sliders to
  - 4 type-in weights (image match, ref model, atom nei, landmark)
  - 4 response 
  - 4 weighted responses
  - sum of weighted responses
- figure stage: change 3 sliders to
  - 2 type-in weights (Image match, landmark)
  - 2 responses
  - 2 weighted responses
  - sum of weighted responses
- MOM: add rotate, translate, scale options?
x write config file from current GUI values


WEB SITE
x new bin pablo page
  - titan/colab/Private/Pablo/dow.html
x package's purpose
- snaps (DK)
- lists package's requirements (windows, matlab, cygwin?)
x pablo logo (indicates binary pablo)
x user guide available with or without install package
x split ImMap into it's own page, with purpose, download pointer
x install package - license req'd

INSTALL PACKAGE
- splash screen includes:
  x colab logo
  - contact info
x queries user as to which dir to install into
x jeong's script needs a NAME! (singleObjStat, multiObjStat)
x documents (doc dir)
  x word -> pdf format
  - the pipeline: [bin_pablo -> jeong script] -> byu scale
  x bin_pablo USER GUIDE
	x purpose
	x usage
    x building a shape model (once)
	x building a landmark model
	  x from an image
	  x from existing shape data
	x image conversion issues
	  x coordinate system, intensity range
	  x image compression (raw3z files)
	x config file contents
  - jeong's matlab script
	- purpose
	- usage
	- how to write a bootstrap script
  - byu_scale
	- purpose
	- usage
  x file formats
  x description of sample data files
  x release notes: changes, known bugs
x libs (lib dir)
  x MSVC 6 DLLs: do not dump into system dir!
- programs (bin dir)
  x pablo.exe (no symbols, DEBUG version!)
  - jeong's matlab scripts (supports bootstrap)
    - can these read data files from another dir?
  x byu_scale.exe (more byu utilites?)
- sample files
  x pablo demo (data/sample1 dir)
    x input
      x registry/config file
      x binary image
	  - mean model (w/ pga stat's)
	  x landmark model
	  x distance map?
    x output
      x fitted model
	  x log file
  - jeong script demo (data/sample2 dir)
	- input
	  - multiple models
	- output
	  - mean model
	  - PGA stats (are these contained in the model?)

USABILITY: after 11-jan
- read/write raw3.gz
- regMerge:
  i insert stat's into model - needed?
  - insert landmarks into shape model
- utility to convert image to raw3
