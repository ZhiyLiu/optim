manpage documentation (I could use some feed back on how C++ man pages
	are structured.  Do you provide one manpage per class or one manpage per
  class function?

Add callbacks COL_RESIZE, ROW_RESIZE

Update list/table as needed for editors.  Should have all functions
	defined now.

General
	Miscellaneous style info...
    I'm thinking of removing global_style from Flv_List and implementing a
		Flv_Style_List with specific indices for GLOBAL_STYLE,
		SELECTION_STYLE, etc.  It would reduce
		the class size and make all those styles optional.  Any existing code
		could #define global_style as styles[GLOBAL_STYLE], hmmm, maybe right
		after editing... ?

  Add selection_style?
    For automatic selection style information.  This would mainly come
    into play in Flv_Table (see below), but would create a nice generic
    way to program what the selected cell(s) look like.

Flv_Table
  Cell editing
  Validation
  Drawing code I think has a few lingering problems, could
    be in Flv_List, but I think it's here.  Probbably need to re-write them
    both to be more standard, and hopefully smaller as well.

  Add fixed_selection_style?
    Apply STYLE_ROW_HEADER, STYLE_ROW_FOOTER, STYLE_COL_HEADER,STYLE_COL_FOOTER
    Would allow for things like auto depressed header styles.  Looks nice in
    spreadsheets.  Not a bad indicator for data tables either.

Flv_CStyle
	Write Flv_CStyle_List.  Flv_CTable will use a Flv_CStyle_List for various
	layouts.  This will probbably also impact get_style significantly.
	
Flv_CTable
  Everything, Including your requests :)

Other widgets
  I would like to implement simple text versions of the widgets that store
  information.

  If you have a general purpose widget that could be based on these and would
  be generally usefull, I will consider writing it.
