        Instructions for Editing the *.fl Files of Pablo


To minimize the number of changes when successive versions of the fluid
control files in Pablo are saved in CVS, please save the files with all
items except the first (outermost) one in the widget browser closed;
that is, have no black arrows pointing down, except on the top line of
the fluid display.  The top item displayed by fluid should also be
selected.

In P3DUserInterface.fl, the displayControlWindow and preferencesEditorWindow
contain tabs.  The .fl file should be saved so the left-most tab in these is
upper-most, contrary to fluid's natural inclination.  This can be achieved
as follows:
    1. Open the make_DisplayControl(...) and make_PreferencesEditor(...)
        function definitions by selecting the black arrows next to them.
    2. Double-click the two movable_Fl_Window definitions.  The windows
        will appear.
    3. Close the definitions of make_DisplayControl(...) and
        make_PreferencesEditor(...) by again selecting the black arrows,
        which now point down.
    4. On the Display Control window, select the General tab.
    5. On the Preferences Editor window, select the Display tab.
    6. In the fluid window, click on the top line, "class P#DUserInterface".
    7. Destroy the Preferences Editor and Display Control windows by
        clicking the X in their upper right corners.
    8. In fluid, select File/Write Code, File/Save and File/Quit.

Please perform this sequence every time the fluid files are to be checked
into CVS.
