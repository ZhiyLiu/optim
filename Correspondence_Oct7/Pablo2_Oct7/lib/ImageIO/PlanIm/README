This code is taken from PLUNC version 6700.  The files are a combination of
those in libplanio and libxdr.  Most files have not been modified; a few were
slightly modified to eliminate warnings.

With this version, PLUNC supports compression of images using zlib.  The
version of zlib required is more recent than that used previously for raw3
files.  As there seemed to be no compatibility problems when upgrading zlib,
the files in ../../zlib were also upgraded with this change.  Testing showed
that at compression level 1, which is used in PLUNC, newly compressed raw3
files can be read by old versions of Pablo2.

The new zlib code is virtually identical to that in PLUNC.  Only one .h file
had to be changed for WIN32 systems.

When installing this new version of libplanio, it was discovered that the
PLUNC code contained a bug in xdr_plan_defs.cxx.  This was fixed in the 6700
branch, but not in the primary version, so it is possible that later comparison
my not reflect the same changes.

Another change was the addition of the in_place argument to write_scan_xy().
Since PLUNC never uses an image array after it is written, it has no problem
with corrupting the array by compressing it in place.  This is usually not
the case in Pablo or in ConStruct, since the image is usually being displayed.
The changes made correct this problem.

Because of the new capability for compressing, file ../src/ImageIO.cpp was
changed slightly to determine if output plan_im files were to be compressed,
by examining the CompressImages setting in the globalControl object.  No
capability for converting them automatically was added, however.

One minor change was the addition of the O_BINARY definition to libplanio.h.
