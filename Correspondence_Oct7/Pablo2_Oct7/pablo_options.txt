The pablo program can take the following command line options, which on
Microsoft Windows may be prefixed by either `-' or `/'.

option      argument    effect
------      --------    ------

-h[elp]     none        Prints out a brief usage message and exits.

-c[d]       ctrl_dir    Specifies that the indicated directory is to be
                        searched for the pablo control file (described
                        below).

-i[mage]    filename    Causes the indicated image file to loaded.

-l[eft]     none        Specifies that a left-handed mouse will be used.
                        This option is not present on Microsoft Windows
                        systems.  It has minimal effect on the program, but
                        some users may wish to alias 'pablo' to 'pablo -l',
                        to indicate their mouse button order preference.

-m[odel]    filename    Causes the indicated model file to loaded.  The
                        model may also be specified as the last item on the
                        command line, without the -model option.

-n[ot]      none        Do nothing; causes pablo to exit.  Useful only
                        with -v, which otherwise starts up Pablo.

-q[uiet]    none        Reduces the amount of printed information.

-r[eg]      [n s]       Regularize the specified input model n iterations of
			step size s and then halt.  Default values for n and
			s are 40 and 0.01, respectively.

-R[elease]              Causes the program's version number (date and time)
			to be printed.

-u[n]       none        Non-interactively uncompress the image file given
                        with -image and then halt.

-v[erbose]              Increases the amount of information that is printed.

-x          none        Perform non-interactive compression of the image file
                        specified using -image and then halt.


The program can also take as its final option the path of a model file,
if the -model option is not used.

If pablo detects incorrect options, it will exit with a return code of -1.

The user-specific settings used by pablo (preferences) are read from a
control file.  The contents of this file are described below.  This
file should be named .pablo and go in the user's home directory on UNIX
and LINUX.  For Windows NT, it should be named pablo.txt and go in the
user's profile directory.  For Windows 95/98, pablo.txt must be in the
directory from which the program is run.  In all cases, however, another
directory containing the control file can be specified by using the "-cd"
or "/cd" option.

The format is one definition per line, with each definition consisting of
a key name followed by the equal sign, which must be followed by a value.
Each line must be followed by a semicolon.  White space may be used to
improve readability.  The following table explains the possibilities.

key name                values          meaning
--------                ------          -------

BackgroundColor_R       [0.0, 1.0]      Components (red, green and blue) of
BackgroundColor_G       [0.0, 1.0]      the background color of model window.
BackgroundColor_B       [0.0, 1.0]      If they are omitted, dark blue is used.

AtomVectorsType         0, 1            With a value of 0 (the default), unit
                                        vectors will be drawn on atoms.  A
                                        value of 1 causes the B vector to have
                                        correctly proportional length and to
                                        show the eta extension in the case of
                                        end atoms.  See BVectorsType also.

BVectorsType            0, 1            With a value of 0 (the default), no B
                                        vectors will be drawn.  A value of 1 
                                        causes all B vector to be drawn.  A
                                        value of 2 causes B vectors only to be
                                        drawn for crest (end) atoms.  See
					AtomVectorsType also.

AtomVectorsLineWidth    1, 2, ..., 10   The integer number of pixels wide
                                        atom vectors will be drawn.  Only
                                        small values are reasonable, and the
                                        default is 1.

ShowAtomVectors         0, 1            If this is 0, no vectors will be
                                        drawn on atoms.  The default value
                                        is 1, which causes the B and two
                                        sail plane vectors to be shown.

ExtraAtomVectors        0, 1            If 1, the N and B-Perp frame vectors
                                        will be shown on atoms.  Normally this
                                        is 0.

FiguresColorAtoms       0, 1            If this is 1, then atoms will always be
                                        given a color very close to that of the
                                        figure containng them.  The default of
                                        0, results in all atoms being yellow.
                                        This control has no effect on the color
                                        of the marked atom.

MeshConnectorsType      0, 1            A value of 1 causes the medial mesh
                                        to be drawn using dotted lines.  The
                                        default value is 0, which gives
                                        solid lines.

MeshConnectorsLineWidth 1, 2, ..., 10   The integer number of pixels wide
                                        mesh connectors will be drawn.  Only
                                        small values are reasonable, and the
                                        default is 1.

ShowMeshConnectors      0, 1            A value of 0 surpresses drawing of the
                                        medial mesh.  Normally it is drawn, so
                                        the default value of this is 1.

ConnectorsColor_R       [0.0, 1.0]      Components (red, green and blue) of
ConnectorsColor_G       [0.0, 1.0]      the color used for drawing mesh
ConnectorsColor_B       [0.0, 1.0]      connectors.  If no color is specified,
                                        medium green is used.

SmoothImages            0, 1            If 1, bilinear interpolation will
                                        be used to produce smoother looking
                                        slice views and cut planes.

AxialSliceDefault       0, 1            Setting any of these to 1 activates
CoronalSliceDefault     0, 1            the corresponding control on the Image

SurfaceLineWidth        1, 2, ..., 10   The line width used for drawing wire
                                        frame figures.  Also the width of dots
                                        used when drawing point cloud figures.

TwoLights               0, 1            If 1, then solid surfaces will receive
                                        more lighting.

SurfaceSmoothnessDefault  0 - 90        Default value, used when creating
                                        figures, of the amount of variance
                                        from perpendicularity of the surface
                                        to the atom vectors allowed when
                                        rendering.  If not specified, a
                                        value of 50 (very smooth) is used.

PartialSurfaceRendering 0, 1            Controls the drawing of governed
                                        surfaces during setting of the
                                        interpenetration constraints.  If
                                        1, the entire surface is displayed
                                        using two colors.  If 0, which is
                                        the default, only the part within
                                        the cutoff value is rendered.

PartialSurfaceStyle     0 - 3           Controls the drawing of surfaces
                                        during setting of the interpenetration
                                        constraints.
                                        0 = do not display surfaces
                                        1 = wire frame display of surfaces
                                        2 = solid display of surfaces

PartialSurfaceLevel     1 - 4           Level of detail for display of
                                        partial surfaces figures during the
                                        setting of the interpenetration
                                        constraints.

PartialSurfaceColor_R   [0.0, 1.0]      Components (red, green and blue) of
PartialSurfaceColor_G   [0.0, 1.0]      the color to be used when displaying
PartialSurfaceColor_B   [0.0, 1.0]      partial surfaces.

ShowConstraints         0, 1            If 0, constraints that have been set
                                        will be shown at all times.  The
                                        default is 0.

DrawCutPlaneBoundary    0, 1            If 0, figure surface boundaries will
                                        not be drawn in cut plane views.  The
                                        default is 1.

CutPlaneBoundaryWidth   1, 2, ..., 6    The integer width in pixels of the
                                        surface boundary drawn cut plane views.
                                        The default is 1.

CutPlaneMode            0, 1, 2         The default setting for viewing of cut
                                        planes.  A one indicates that only
                                        separate cut plane views will be shown.
                                        Two means the views will be inside the
                                        model window.  A zero, which is the
                                        default, causes both to be shown.

RockingAngle            degrees         Half-angle of rocking motion used
                                        when activated.  The default is 20
                                        degrees.

RockingIncrement        degrees         Angular change between successive views
                                        when rocking motion is on.  This
                                        controls the apparent speed of the
                                        rocking.  The default is 0.5 degree.

BYUOutputType           0, 1            Specifies the type of BYU tiles that
                                        may be exported.  0 specifies triangles
                                        and 1 means quadrangles.  The default
                                        is 0 to produce triangles.

BYUOutputCoords         0, 1            Specifies whether coordinates in BYU
                                        tile files are to be written in world
                                        coordinates (1) or not (0).  The default
                                        is to write then in model coordinates.
                                        An image file must be loaded at the time
                                        of writing for this option to have any
                                        effect.

ShowLandmarks           0, 1            If 0, landmarks that have been set
                                        will be shown at all times.  The
                                        default is 0.

LandmarkNarrowWidth     1, 2, ..., 10   The integer number of pixels wide
                                        most landmarks will be drawn.  Only
                                        small values are reasonable, and the
                                        default is 1.

LandmarkWideWidth       1, 2, ..., 10   The integer number of pixels wide the
                                        marked landmark will be drawn.  Usually
                                        larger than the LandmarkNarrowWidth;
                                        the default is 3.

LandmarksColor_R        [0.0, 1.0]      Components (red, green and blue) of
LandmarksColor_G        [0.0, 1.0]      the default color of landmarks, used
LandmarksColor_B        [0.0, 1.0]      only with point cloud or wire frame
                                        rendering.  The default is orange.

UndoListLength          commands        Number of permitted undo's (ctrl-Z).
                                        The default is 250.

LeftHandedMouse         0, 1            True if the user uses a left-handed
                                        mouse, with reversed right and left
                                        buttons.  On Microsoft Windows systems
                                        this is not used, although it is
                                        reported and may be set in the
                                        preferences editing window.  On other
                                        systems, the -l[eft] option also may
                                        be used to override the set value.

IconifyMode             0, 1, 2         A 0 indicates that each window must be
                                        iconfified/deiconified independently.
                                        A 1 is the same, except that iconifying
                                        or deiconifying the main window causes
                                        all windows to be opened or closed.  A
                                        2 causes the same action to be applied
                                        to all windows that is applied to any

ReorderModels           -1, 0, 1        Controls the behavior when saving
                                        unordered, multi-figural models.
                                        -1 = prompt the user for an action
                                        0 = never reorder before saving
                                        1 = always reorder before saving

ModelDirectory          path            The path to the last directory from
                                        which models were loaded.  This will
                                        be the directory first listed in the
                                        browser for loading model files.
                                        It should not end with a slash (/).

ImageDirectory          path            The path to the last directory from
                                        which images were loaded.  This will
                                        be the directory first listed in the
                                        browser for loading image files.  If
                                        identical to the ModelDirectory, this
                                        is stored as an empty string.  It
                                        should not end with a slash (/).

TileSetDirectory        path            The path to the last directory from
                                        which tile sets were loaded.  This will
                                        be the directory first listed in the
                                        browser for loading tile set files.  If
                                        identical to the ModelDirectory, this
                                        is stored as an empty string.  It
                                        should not end with a slash (/).

OutputVerbosity         -1, 0, 1        A value of 1 causes more output to be
                                        printed by Pablo than a value of 0.
                                        A -1 causes less to be printed.  This
                                        affects informational messages only;
                                        error messages and warnings are always
                                        printed.

CompressImages          0, 1            Causes output images to be written in
                                        a compressed form, when the value is
                                        1.  Otherwise, they will not be
                                        compressed, taking much more disk
                                        space.

ConvertImages           0, 1            If 1, then existing images will be
                                        converted when they are read, from
                                        uncompressed to compressed, or the
                                        reverse, depending on the setting of
                                        CompressImages.

ConvertImageFormat      0, 1            If 1, then when an image file is read
                                        that has a different format than that
                                        specified by ImageFormat, the file will
                                        be rewritten into that format.  If 0,
                                        then no action is taken.

ImageFormat             0, 1            The number of the image file format to
                                        be written.

ByteOrder               0, 1, 2, 3      This is the preferred byte order with
                                        which image files will be written.  The
                                        values corresponds to Reverse, Native,
                                        Normal, and Retain, respectively.  PCs
                                        have "reverse" byte order, while most
                                        Unix machines have "normal" order.
                                        Native means "use the order found on
                                        the machine running Pablo", while
                                        Retain means the same as Native, unless
                                        the image is being converted, in which
                                        case the conversion will not change
                                        the order from the original image file.


The remaining entries in this table are for the positioning of the windows
and the indication of which ones are to be open at the start of the program.
Both of these can be recorded by selecting a button on the Preferences
window.  The xxxxWindow_Open tags are merely listed here.  Any of them having
a value of 1 will result in that window being opened at startup.  However, the
main window and model window are always opened, regardless of the settings.
Similarly, the settings for the Cut Plane windows are ignored, because those
windows can only be opened by pressing buttons on the Cut Planes Control
window.
