calculatePGA.m - matlab script to compute shape statistics of m-rep models 

* RUNNING THE SCRIPT IN MATLAB

1.Add to matlab search paths the paths to '/functions', '/ios',
  '/output-plot', and the directory where the five class directories
  (@QuadPrimitive, @QuadSymPrimitive, @SrepQuadPrimitive, @TubePrimitive,
  @TubeSymPrimitive) are.

2.Set the following parameters in the configuration file 'param.txt'

 alignMode = 2;      	 % 0-Skip alignment, 1-translation, 2-rigid, 3-simXform
 figNames = [Phantom];   % figure name stored in output mean m3d file
 nComp = [5];            % number of pgs whose variances are displayed in
                         % eigenvalue plot  
 nProj = [5];            % number of pgs that will be stored in output pga file

 Notes: 1) 'nComp' must not be smaller than 'nProj'.
        2) Leave the rest of the fields as they are. 
        3) If 'alignMode' is set to a value other than 0, the script will
           make an 'M3dAligned' directory where aligned models are stored.

3. Specifiy input parameters to the script
    workingDir - output directory where mean/pga m3d file, eigenvalue
                 plot, is stored
    m3dDir     - input directory where training m3d files are stored
    fileFilter - file specification to select only certain m3d files 
		 in 'm3dDir' for training pga statistics
                 ex) 'a*.m3d'- m3d files starting with 'a'
    paramFile  - path to the configuration file for this script 
    savePrefix - (optional) string to add in front of certain output files
                 (recommended to avoid output files beginning with '.')
    skipNumer  - (optional) number of m3d files to leave out in training 
		 statistics(for leave-one-out experiment)
    successiveDist - (optional) training from 1st fraction to i-th fraction 
                     where i = 2 ... N, N is the size of training sample

4. Run the script. 
   calculatePGA(workingDir, m3dDir, fileFilter, paramFile, savePrefix, skipNumber)

*OUTPUT FILES

SymMean.m3d: mean m3d model
Sym.pga:     pg statistics
SymEVs.txt:  eigenvalues (eValsPGA_global.jpg-eigenvalue plot)
Data.mat:    intermediate matlab data file in which mean and stats are stored.
	     Note: You need to delete this file if you want to run the
             script fresh on the same training data.
