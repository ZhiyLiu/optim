found 3 bad s-reps in the training set, they are:
N0147-2-3
N0177-1-01
T0036-1-1-03

get ride of them, and redo this experiment for the rest 31 sreps. Variables begin from 0.

Start from 0 because the variables gotten from previous iteration, after get ride of the 3 srep, they are almost the same...
